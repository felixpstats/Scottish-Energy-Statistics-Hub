<p>The electricity transmission network links Scotland to England and Wales and the Moyle undersea cable links Scotland to Northern Ireland. Throughout the year when <strong>Scottish </strong>electricity <strong>generation exceeds </strong>Scottish <strong>demand </strong>electricity is <strong>exported</strong>. Likewise when <strong>demand exceeds generation </strong>electricity is <strong>imported</strong>.</p>
<p>The fact that Scotland&rsquo;s own supply is secure, and its abundant generation of electricity via wind means that Scotland has long been a <strong>net exporter </strong>of electricity. In <strong>2020</strong>, Scotland <strong>exported </strong>almost<strong> 20.4 TWh</strong>, equivalent to powering every household in Scotland for 26 months. This had an estimated <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/data-portal/wholesale-market-indicators">wholesale value</a> of almost <strong>&pound;763 million</strong>.</p>
<p>In recent years, <strong>imports </strong>have <strong>increased </strong>as well, rising from approximately <strong>200 GWh </strong>in <strong>2014 </strong>to <strong>more than 1 TWh</strong> for every year since <strong>2016</strong>. This is possibly a consequence of the closure of the coal-fired power station at Longannet in 2016, which has meant that there has been a potential need for Scotland to have non-intermittent electricity generation available.</p>
<p>This all means that Scotland&rsquo;s <strong>net exports </strong>of electricity (exports minus imports) in <strong>2020 </strong>was <strong>19.3 TWh</strong>, its highest to date.</p>
