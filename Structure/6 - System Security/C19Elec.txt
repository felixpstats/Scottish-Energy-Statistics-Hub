<p>As a result of restrictions in response to covid-19, electricity use in Scotland declined significantly.&nbsp; Average daily electricity demand in Scotland in <strong>2020</strong> was <strong>11%</strong> <strong>lower</strong> than in <strong>2019</strong>.&nbsp; As restrictions loosened, demand returned closer to 2019 levels, diverging again in Winter when new restrictions were brought in.&nbsp;<strong>2021&nbsp;</strong>has started with increased restrictions, although the difference in demand appears less pronounced so far than compared to the original lockdown.</p>
