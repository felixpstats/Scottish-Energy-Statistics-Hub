<p><strong>Gas demand has also changed,</strong></p>
<p>Gas demand is trickier to interpret as gas demand depends largely on climatic conditions, hence variations in previous years.&nbsp; The data available has not been weather corrected.&nbsp; However, average daily gas demand dropped by <strong>46%</strong> from the <strong>first to the second quarter</strong> of <strong>2020</strong>, which lines up with when lockdown was imposed, compared to a <strong>42%</strong> reduction for the equivalent period in <strong>2019</strong>.</p>
<p>In the<strong> 4th quarter</strong> of <strong>2020</strong>, where there were also some restrictions, average daily has demand was <strong>7% lower</strong> than the same quarter in <strong>2019</strong>, and the <strong>lowest</strong> since <strong>2016</strong>.</p>
<p>It is likely that at least some of this reduction is because of reduced activity since lockdown. Indeed, National Grid expects that any growth in domestic demand due to people being housebound during lockdown will be far outweighed by the expected reduction in demand from businesses and industry.</p>
