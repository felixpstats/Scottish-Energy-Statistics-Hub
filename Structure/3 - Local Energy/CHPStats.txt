<p>In <strong>2017</strong>, Scotland had <strong>170 </strong>separate <strong>combined heat and power schemes</strong>, and this has steadily <strong>risen </strong>from <strong>70 </strong>in <strong>2005</strong>. In total, Scotland&rsquo;s combined heat and power schemes generated <strong>6,205 GWh </strong>of <strong>heat </strong>in 2017 which would have been wasted otherwise, a small increase on last year. The heat generated is the equivalent of heating approximately <strong>452,000 homes </strong>in <strong>Scotland </strong>using the estimate for the average domestic gas consumption per household.</p>
<p>While the number of CHP <strong>schemes </strong>in Scotland have <strong>increased</strong>, the amount of <strong>heat generated </strong>has <strong>dropped </strong>by more than <strong>2,200 GWh </strong>from its peak in <strong>2005</strong>. This mirrors the UK wide trend of larger industrial based schemes that generate high amounts of heat ending and the growth of smaller non-industrial schemes.</p>
<p>Oil and gas is the sector which accounts for most of Scotland&rsquo;s CHP capacity (248 MW, 44.5%).</p>
