<p>The chart shows the&nbsp;<strong>gross value added&nbsp;</strong>(GVA) associated with the offshore&nbsp;<strong>oil and gas production&nbsp;</strong>which is estimated to occur in the Scottish portion of the UKCS. In&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, the extraction of oil and gas is estimated to have been worth&nbsp;<strong>&pound;16.2 billion&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>GVA&nbsp;</strong>to the&nbsp;<strong>Scottish economy</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of oil and gas to the Scottish economy has increased for the second consecutive year,&nbsp;<strong>up&nbsp;</strong>by&nbsp;<strong>&pound;4.3 billion&nbsp;</strong>on 2017 to its highest level since 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is likely a consequence of&nbsp;<strong>increased prices</strong>.</p>
<p>Oil and gas production is equivalent&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>9.1%&nbsp;</strong>of total&nbsp;<strong>Scottish GDP&nbsp;</strong>(including a geographical share of UK Extra Regio activity) in 2018, it&rsquo;s highest share of GDP since 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
