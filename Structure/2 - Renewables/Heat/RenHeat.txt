<p>Scotland generated <strong>5,008 GWh </strong>of renewable heat in <strong>2020</strong>, a record year for renewable heat. This is the equivalent of supplying over <strong>360,000 Scottish homes&nbsp;</strong>with gas for the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2009 Renewable Heat Action Plan set a target of delivering&nbsp;<strong>11%&nbsp;</strong>of Scotland&rsquo;s non-electrical heat demand from renewable sources by <strong>2020</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;<strong>2020</strong>, useful renewable heat generated in Scotland was equivalent to&nbsp;<strong>6.3% </strong>of fuels (besides electricity) consumed for heat, the same as in <strong>2019</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst there was a rise in renewable heat generation, the majority of which is due to an <strong>83 GWh increase</strong> from <strong>heat pumps, </strong>heat demand also rose. There has also been a reduction in large biomass output that has limited overall growth.</p>
