<p>The electricity generation mix in Scotland has significantly changed in recent years driven by privatisation and subsidy schemes introduced to encourage the development of low carbon and renewable technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has meant that the vast majority of the electricity that Scotland generates is from&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong>&nbsp;sources,&nbsp;<strong>86.4%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>, <strong>compared to 12.7% generated from fossil fuels.</strong>&nbsp; The sources of electricity generation in Scotland have changed rapidly since&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong>&nbsp;when approximately half of Scotland&rsquo;s generation came from&nbsp;each of&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong>&nbsp;sources and&nbsp;<strong>fossil fuels</strong>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>growth of renewables </strong>drove the increase in low carbon generation, rising from&nbsp;<strong>19.0%</strong>&nbsp;of all generation in&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong> to <strong>61.1%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>, the highest level to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;National and international incentives, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/ro">Renewables Obligation</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive">EU Renewable Energy Directive</a>, contributed towards the increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast,&nbsp;<strong>England and Wales</strong>&nbsp;use a significantly&nbsp;<strong>smaller proportion</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong> (<strong>48.9%</strong>)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>renewable </strong>(<strong>32.3%</strong>)&nbsp;sources for electricity generation than Scotland.&nbsp;<strong>Fossil fuels</strong>&nbsp;comprise half (<strong>48.6%</strong>) of England and Wales&rsquo; electricity generation, with&nbsp;<strong>gas</strong>&nbsp;making up most of this (<strong>45.9% </strong>of all generation).</p>
