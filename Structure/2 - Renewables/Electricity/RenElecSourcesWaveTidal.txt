<p>Current capacity of&nbsp;<strong>wave&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>tidal&nbsp;</strong>in Scotland is relatively small (<strong>22</strong>&nbsp;<strong>MW&nbsp;</strong>in <strong>September 2020</strong>), but Scotland is leading the way in the UK in this area - in <strong>2019</strong>, <strong>17 </strong>out of the 20 wave and tidal <strong>sites </strong>in the UK were in Scotland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also a developing technology; projects totalling&nbsp;<strong>350 MW&nbsp;</strong>are in the&nbsp;<strong>pipeline</strong>, including Brims Tidal Array in the Orkney Islands with 200 MW capacity alone.&nbsp;</p>
