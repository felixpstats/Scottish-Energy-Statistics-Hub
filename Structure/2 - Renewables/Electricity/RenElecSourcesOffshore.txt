<p>Since the Beatrice wind farm in the Moray Firth became operational in 2019, <strong>offshore wind</strong> capacity rose from 0.2 GW to <strong>0.9&nbsp;GW</strong>.&nbsp; This led to&nbsp;<strong>3.5 TWh</strong>&nbsp;of electricity generated via offshore wind in <strong>2020, </strong>up from <strong>1.4 TWh </strong>in <strong>2018</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offshore wind is likely to play more of a role in the future; <strong>12 </strong>offshore wind projects totalling <strong>4.2 GW</strong> are in&nbsp;<strong>development</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>1.5 GW</strong> is&nbsp; currently <strong>under construction</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Electricity generation via offshore wind may have generated&nbsp;<strong>&pound;0.26 billion</strong>&nbsp;in turnover in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, but has directly supported approximately&nbsp;<strong>1,700&nbsp;</strong>full-time equivalent&nbsp;<strong>jobs&nbsp;</strong>in Scotland.</p>
