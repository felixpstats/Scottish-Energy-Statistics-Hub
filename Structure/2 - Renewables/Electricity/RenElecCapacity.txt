<p>Scotland had <strong>12.2 GW </strong>of installed renewable electricity generation <strong>capacity operational in September 2021</strong>. This has steadily risen over time, however, has levelled off since June 2019 possibly as fewer projects have been able to access subsidies.&nbsp; This may slow Scotland's progress in renewable electricity generation.&nbsp; Most of Scotland&rsquo;s operational capacity comes from <strong>onshore wind</strong> (<strong>8.7 GW</strong>), with <strong>offshore wind</strong> (<strong>0.9 GW</strong>) capacity increasing in the last few years.</p>
<p>Half of the renewable capacity in Scotland comes from <strong>large installations</strong> of over 50 MW (<strong>6.2 GW</strong> in total).&nbsp; However, a total of <strong>1.3GW</strong> comes from <strong>small-scale installations</strong> of less than 5 MW.&nbsp; These projects are important as they are likely to contribute to the development of smart, decentralised and local energy markets in Scotland.&nbsp; This is made up of <strong>0.5 GW </strong>of <strong>onshore wind</strong>, <strong>0.4 GW </strong>of <strong>solar PV</strong>, <strong>0.3 GW </strong>of <strong>hydro</strong> and <strong>0.1 GW </strong>of <strong>bioenergy and waste</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
