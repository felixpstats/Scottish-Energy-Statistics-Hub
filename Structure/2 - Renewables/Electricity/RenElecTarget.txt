<p>The Scottish Government has a target to generate the equivalent of&nbsp;<strong>100%</strong>&nbsp;of Scotland&rsquo;s own electricity demand from renewable sources by&nbsp;<strong>2020</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not mean that Scotland will be fully dependent on renewables generation, but rather that renewables will form the key part of a wider, balanced electricity mix.</p>
<p>Provisional figures for <strong>2020 </strong>indicate that&nbsp;the equivalent of <strong>95.9% </strong>of gross electricity consumption* was from renewable sources, rising from&nbsp;<strong>88.4% </strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>.&nbsp; This increase stems from the <strong>1.9 TWh</strong> increase in <strong>renewable electricity generation</strong>, of which, <strong>0.9 TWh</strong> was from <strong>Hydro</strong> and <strong>0.7 TWh</strong> from <strong>onshore wind</strong>. This falls just short of the 100% by 2020 <strong>renewable electricity target.</strong></p>

<p>* Gross electricity consumption refers to total electricity generation minus net exports</p>
