<p>The main mechanism for the promotion of biofuel use, the&nbsp;<strong>Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO)&nbsp;</strong>legislation places a requirement on transport fuel suppliers to ensure that a percentage of all road vehicle fuel is supplied from sustainable renewable sources.</p>
<p>Data for&nbsp;<strong>biofuels&nbsp;</strong>in petrol and diesel consumption is&nbsp;<strong>not available&nbsp;</strong>separately for&nbsp;<strong>Scotland</strong>, so for the purposes of calculating the renewable energy target for Scotland the&nbsp;<strong>UK proportion&nbsp;</strong>of biofuels is assumed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, biofuels had a&nbsp;<strong>4.0%&nbsp;</strong>share of road fuels in the&nbsp;<strong>UK</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has risen to its&nbsp;<strong>highest level</strong>, up from&nbsp;<strong>3.1%&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It still remains some way off the&nbsp;<strong>9.75%&nbsp;</strong>share of renewable fuels by&nbsp;<strong>2020&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;which was an ambition under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-regulations-to-double-the-use-of-sustainable-renewable-fuels-by-2020" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-regulations-to-double-the-use-of-sustainable-renewable-fuels-by-2020&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567579605277000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIy3fNjyI4-_4aeY5p95YYNIYgLA">UK RTFO.</a></p>
