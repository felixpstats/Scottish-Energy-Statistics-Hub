<p>The Scottish Government has announced its intention phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032, and has supported moves to <strong>ultra-low emission vehicles</strong> (ULEVs). This term refers to electric, plug-in hybrid, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles and all vehicles with tail-pipe emissions below 75 g/km of CO2.</p>
<p>As of March 20189, there were <strong>12,453</strong> ULEVs licenced in Scotland, of which 5,502 are battery electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Even though ULEVs only make up <strong>0.4%</strong> of all vehicles licenced in Scotland, <strong>growth</strong> has been <strong>rapid</strong>: compared to twelve months prior, <strong>an extra 4,050 ULEVs</strong> have been licenced, of which approximately 1,460 are battery electric vehicles. Growth of ULEVs has been greater among plug-in hybrids than electric battery vehicles.</p>
<p>The growth of ULEVs can be further illustrated by looking at the proportion of ULEVs <strong>registered for the first time.</strong> This has risen from <strong>0.2%</strong> of all newly registered vehicles in the <strong>first quarter</strong> of <strong>2014</strong> to <strong>1.8%</strong> in <strong>Q1 2019</strong>. Scottish Government&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> details aims for registration of ULEVs to reach <strong>100%</strong> by <strong>2032.</strong></p>
<p>Recorded consumption across the ChargePlace Scotland, Scotland&rsquo;s public EV charging network, is&nbsp;<strong>5,589 MWh</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, up from&nbsp;<strong>3,536 MWh</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2017.</strong></p>
