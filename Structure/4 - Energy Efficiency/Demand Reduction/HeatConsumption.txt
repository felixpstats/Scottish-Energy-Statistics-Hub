<p>Reducing heat demand is a key priority identified in the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/heat-policy-statement-towards-decarbonising-heat-maximising-opportunities-scotland/">Scottish Government Heat Policy Statement</a> published in 2015.</p>
<p>Non-electrical <strong>heat demand </strong>follows a similar pattern to electricity; consumption steadily <strong>declined, dropping </strong>by <strong>17.1% </strong>to <strong>79.7 TWh&nbsp;</strong>from <strong>2005-07</strong> to <strong>2018</strong>. This decline may be a result of improved energy efficiency, improvements in the building stock, rising gas prices and rising temperatures.&nbsp; This is a <strong>2.2% drop </strong>from <strong>2017, </strong>mainly driven by reduction of petroleum use for process heat in industry.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There is an aim published in the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> to <strong>reduce domestic</strong> heat demand by <strong>15%</strong> and <strong>non-domestic</strong> heat demand by <strong>20%</strong> between <strong>2015 </strong>and <strong>2032</strong>. &nbsp;However, non-electrical heat demand <strong>increased</strong> from <strong>2015</strong>, up by <strong>2.6%</strong>, more so in the <strong>domestic</strong> (<strong>3.7%</strong> increase) than the <strong>non-domestic</strong> sector (<strong>1.8%</strong> increase). This may be explained by lower gas and oil prices and unseasonal weather conditions.</p>
