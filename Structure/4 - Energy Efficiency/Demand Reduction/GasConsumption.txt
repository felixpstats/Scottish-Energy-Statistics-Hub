<p><strong>Gas</strong> consumption dropped by <strong>20.5%</strong> overall from <strong>2005-07</strong> to <strong>2019</strong>. The saving in gas consumption between 2005 and 2019 is the equivalent of almost half of the annual gas use in Scottish homes. Reduction in gas demand compared to 2005 is greater in the <strong>non-domestic </strong>sector (<strong>25.5%</strong> reduction) than the <strong>domestic</strong> sector (<strong>17.0%</strong> reduction).</p>
<p>The annual <strong>average gas consumption per household dropped</strong> by <strong>29.0%</strong> from <strong>2005-07</strong> to <strong>13.7 MWh</strong> in <strong>2019</strong>. In this period, the number of households increased by 8.7%, which illustrates the role that energy efficiency measures and improvements in the building stock made in reducing gas demand.&nbsp; Average gas consumption by household differs by <strong>local authority</strong>, ranging from <strong>11.0 MWh</strong> in the <strong>Western Isles</strong> to <strong>18.3 MWh</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>East Renfrewshire</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite the longer term decrease in gas consumption, it has <strong>stabilised</strong> in <strong>recent years</strong>. In <strong>2018</strong>, gas use is <strong>1.1%</strong> <strong>greater</strong> than its <strong>lowest point</strong> in <strong>2016</strong>. Falling gas prices may have played a role in this.</p>
