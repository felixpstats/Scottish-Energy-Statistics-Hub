<p>Loft insulation improved rapidly over the last few years. In <strong>2019</strong>, <strong>93% </strong>of Scottish homes were <strong>insulated</strong> to <strong>100mm or more, </strong> similar to 2018 (94%), but up from <strong>73% </strong>in <strong>2007</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This can largely be attributed to the installation of top-up insulation in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>More than three-fifths (<strong>64%</strong>) of dwellings have loft <strong>insulation</strong> of <strong>200mm or more </strong>in<strong> 2019</strong>, a substantial rise from <strong>18% </strong>in <strong>2007</strong>. This is still short of the aim in Scottish Government&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> that <strong>70% </strong>of lofts in the residential sector will have at least <strong>200 mm </strong>of insulation by <strong>2020</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>30%</strong> of lofts were insulated to a high standard of insulation (<strong>300 mm</strong> or more), outlining scope for improvement to the highest level. This proportion has remained about this level since 2015, following year on year increases from <strong>5%</strong> in <strong>2010</strong>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>By <strong>2018</strong>, <strong>government schemes </strong>(CERT and ECO) delivered around <strong>480,000 </strong>loft insulation measures in Scotland.</p>
<p>The <strong>impact </strong>of loft insulation in terms of energy saving is not as great as wall insulation; the average <strong>saving </strong>in 2017 for Scottish homes was <strong>200 kWh</strong>, or <strong>1.7% </strong>of energy consumption.</p>
