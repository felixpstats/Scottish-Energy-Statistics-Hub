<p>In <strong>2019</strong>, almost six out of every ten dwellings (<strong>59%</strong>) had some form of <strong>wall insulation</strong>. This comes close to meeting the aim in Scottish Government&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> that <strong>60%</strong> of walls will be insulated by <strong>2020</strong>. The proportion of dwelling with wall insulation is similar to 2018, but the longer term trend shows an increase.&nbsp;Levels of wall insulation remain higher in the <strong>social</strong> sector at <strong>70%</strong> compared with <strong>55%</strong> in the <strong>private</strong> sector.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between cavity and solid wall dwellings, however; <strong>73% </strong>of cavity wall dwellings have <strong>insulation </strong>whereas just <strong>18% </strong>of solid wall dwellings have <strong>solid wall insulation </strong>in<strong> 2019</strong>. Both types of insulation have seen longer term improvements but are unchanged on last year.</p>
<p>Between the <strong>CERT </strong>and <strong>ECO </strong>schemes, there were around <strong>396,000 wall insulation measures </strong>installed by the end of <strong>2019 - </strong>approximately <strong>322,000 cavity wall </strong>insulation measures <strong>and 74,000 solid wall </strong>measures<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>We can look at the <strong>impact </strong>of wall insulation in terms of energy consumption and cost savings using BEIS&rsquo; <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/720120/Scotland_impact_of_measures_2015.xlsx">impact of measures</a> analysis. It looks at savings between the years 2016 and 2018 where wall insulation has been installed in 2017. <strong>Cavity wall insulation </strong>saved Scottish homes an average of <strong>1,300 kWh </strong>or <strong>9.3% </strong>of <strong>energy consumption </strong>and <strong>solid wall insulation </strong>saved <strong>1,900 kWh </strong>or <strong>12.1% </strong>of <strong>energy consumption</strong>.</p>
