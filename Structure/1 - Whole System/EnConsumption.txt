<p>Party and bullshit.  One of the core principles of the Energy Strategy is that it advocates a &ldquo;whole-system&rdquo; view of energy in Scotland. This means that the focus of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s energy policy covers <strong>heat </strong>and <strong>transport</strong>, alongside <strong>electricity </strong>and <strong>energy efficiency </strong>and the interactions between these sectors. It also considers the interaction of energy with the broader economy and society. <strong>Heating </strong>makes up <strong>half </strong>of Scotland&rsquo;s energy consumption and <strong>transport </strong>and <strong>electricity </strong>make up approximately a <strong>quarter </strong>each.</p>
<p>A whole-system view means that we should be considering all sectors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including <strong>domestic </strong>and <strong>non-domestic </strong>(i.e. industrial and commercial) sectors. A breakdown by sector of non-transport energy consumption shows that <strong>58.1% </strong>of is accounted for by the <strong>industrial </strong>and <strong>commercial </strong>sectors, with <strong>41.9% </strong>consumed <strong>domestically</strong>.</p>
