<p>Scotland's renewable energy target is calculated by the sum of renewable electricity and heat generation and estimated biofuel use in transport in Scotland, divided by Scotland's gross electricity consumption, non-electrical heat demand and energy used for transport. Therefore, progress towards the target will come from&nbsp;<strong>increasing renewable generation&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;reducing energy consumption.</strong></p>
<p>Provisional figures for&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>&nbsp;indicate that&nbsp;<strong>19.8%</strong>&nbsp;of total Scottish energy consumption came from renewable sources; the highest level to date. It has&nbsp;<strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>15.8%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2016</strong>. This is the largest single year increase on record (up by 6,532 GWh), driven by record years for both renewable electricity and heat generation. The reasons for these rises are an&nbsp;<strong>increase</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>installed capacity</strong>&nbsp;for renewable&nbsp;<strong>electricity</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>heat</strong>&nbsp;on 2016, up by 1.05 GW for electricity and 0.29 GW for heat.</p>
<p>The total amount of renewable energy generated in 2017&nbsp;<strong>(30,970 GWh)</strong>&nbsp;is the equivalent of powering and heating approximately&nbsp;<strong>1.74 million households</strong>&nbsp;in Scotland, assuming average electricity and gas usage for households in Scotland.</p>
<p>Renewable&nbsp;<strong>electricity</strong>&nbsp;contributes to about four-fifths of the progress towards the overall renewable energy target, followed by renewable heat and transport.</p>
