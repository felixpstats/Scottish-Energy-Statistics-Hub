<p>Another way to reflect Scotland's progress in decarbonisation is to look at <strong>carbon productivity</strong>.&nbsp; This is measured as the level of gross value added (<strong>GVA</strong>) <strong>per tonne of CO2e</strong>, or in other words, the amount of production we achieve from each remaining unit of emissions.&nbsp; The higher the value of carbon productivity, the better as it shows that emissions are being minimised while still retaining a strong economy.</p>
<p>Between <strong>1998</strong> and <strong>2018</strong>, carbon productivity almost <strong>quadrupled</strong> to <strong>&pound;3,453 million</strong> GVA per million tonnes of CO2e.&nbsp; This is due to a <strong>45% reduction</strong> in <strong>emissions</strong> and <strong>GVA</strong> more than <strong>doubling</strong> in this period.&nbsp;</p>
