<p>Scotland&rsquo;s <b>energy</b> (including renewables) <b>sector</b> was identified in <a href = 'https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-economic-strategy/'>Scotland&rsquo;s Economic Strategy </a> as one 
                       of the growth sectors in which Scotland can build on existing comparative advantage and increase productivity and growth.
                       The sector is defined using the <b>Standard Industrialisation Classification (SIC) 2007</b> codes which can be found <a href = 'https://www2.gov.scot/Resource/0054/00547085.docx'>here.</a> 
                       As the sector has been defined this way, the figures are not directly comparable with figures on the low carbon and renewable sector
                       or the oil and gas sector later in this document, as they have been defined differently.</p>
