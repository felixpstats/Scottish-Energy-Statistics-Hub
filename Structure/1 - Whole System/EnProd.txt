<p>The 2030 energy productivity target is a measure of the&nbsp;<strong>combination</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>energy consumption</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>output of the economy.</strong>&nbsp;It is measured by the&nbsp;<strong>gross value added (GVA)</strong>&nbsp;achieved in the economy from the&nbsp;<strong>input of one gigawatt hour of energy.</strong>&nbsp;Higher energy productivity means you get more economic activity for each unit of energy being used, in other words, squeezing more value added out of every unit of energy consumed across the economy.</p>
<p>The target is a&nbsp;<strong>30% increase</strong>&nbsp;in energy productivity by&nbsp;<strong>2030</strong>&nbsp;from a baseline of&nbsp;<strong>2015</strong>. This mirrors the improvement in energy productivity seen between&nbsp;<strong>2005</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>2015</strong>&nbsp;(energy productivity increased by&nbsp;<strong>30.9%</strong>&nbsp;in this period, from&nbsp;<strong>&pound;0.729m GVA per GWh</strong>&nbsp;consumed to&nbsp;<strong>&pound;0.955m</strong>).</p>
<p>Provisional figures for&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>&nbsp;estimate that energy productivity in Scotland is&nbsp;<strong>&pound;0.951m GVA per GWh.</strong>&nbsp;This is&nbsp;<strong>0.4%</strong>&nbsp;below the 2015 baseline, and has dropped from&nbsp;<strong>0.6%</strong>&nbsp;above the baseline in&nbsp;<strong>2016.</strong></p>
<p>The reason for the drop in energy productivity is an estimated&nbsp;<strong>2.4%</strong>&nbsp;rise in&nbsp;<strong>energy consumption</strong>&nbsp;between&nbsp;<strong>2016</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>2017.</strong>&nbsp;In the same period&nbsp;<strong>GVA increased</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>1.4%</strong>, but this was not enough to compensate for the increase in consumption.</p>
