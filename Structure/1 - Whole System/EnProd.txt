<p>The 2030 energy productivity target is a measure of the&nbsp;<strong>combination</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>energy consumption</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>output of the economy.</strong>&nbsp;It is measured by the&nbsp;<strong>gross value added (GVA)*</strong> achieved in the economy from the&nbsp;<strong>input of one gigawatt hour of energy.</strong> Higher energy productivity means you get more economic activity for each unit of energy used, in other words, squeezing more value added out of every unit of energy consumed across the economy.</p>
<p>The target is a&nbsp;<strong>30% increase</strong>&nbsp;in energy productivity by&nbsp;<strong>2030</strong>&nbsp;from a baseline of&nbsp;<strong>2015</strong>. This mirrors the improvement in energy productivity between&nbsp;<strong>2005</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>2015</strong>&nbsp;(energy productivity increased by&nbsp;<strong>29.0%</strong>&nbsp;in this period, from&nbsp;<strong>&pound;0.792m GVA per GWh</strong>&nbsp;consumed to&nbsp;<strong>&pound;1.010m</strong>). This was driven by <strong>reducing energy consumption</strong> (<strong>down</strong> by <strong>15.4%</strong>) and <strong>increased GVA</strong> (<strong>up</strong> by <strong>8.6%</strong>)</p>
<p>Provisional figures for 2020 show energy productivity is <strong>&pound;0.961m GVA per GWh,</strong> <strong>5.9% below</strong> the 2015 baseline. <strong>Energy consumption</strong> <strong>decreased</strong>&nbsp;by <strong>0.6%</strong> between <strong>2015</strong> and <strong>2020, </strong>but <strong>GVA fell</strong><strong> 6.5</strong><strong>%</strong> in this period.</p>
<p>Compared to <strong>2019</strong>, energy productivity worsened by <strong>9.9 percentage points</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>2020</strong>, due to a <strong>0.1% decrease</strong> in <strong>consumption</strong> and a <strong>9.7%</strong> <strong>fall</strong> in <strong>GVA</strong>.</p>
