<p>The Greenhouse Gas Inventory breaks down emissions specifically relating to the <strong>supply of energy</strong>.&nbsp; This is further split into emissions associated with the <strong>generation of electricity</strong> and <strong>industrial processes</strong> associated with energy supply, for example, oil and gas extraction, petroleum refining and manufacturing of solid fuels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a&nbsp;<strong>baseline</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>22.7 million tonnes of CO2</strong>, greenhouse gas<strong>&nbsp;emissions</strong>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<strong>energy supply</strong>&nbsp;sector have&nbsp;<strong>fallen 70.1%</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>6.8 million tonnes of CO2</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>. This in large part due to changes in&nbsp;<strong>electricity production</strong>, where a&nbsp;<strong>reduction</strong>&nbsp;in the use of&nbsp;<strong>fossil fuels</strong> for electricity generation has led to an <strong>85.4% decrease</strong> in emissions to&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions associated with industrial processes associated with energy supply have broadly <strong>remained stable </strong>for the past <strong>20 years, </strong><strong>falling </strong>from <strong>6.6</strong> <strong>million tonnes of CO2</strong> in <strong>1999</strong> to a <strong>low</strong> of <strong>4.1 million tonnes </strong>of<strong> CO2 </strong>in<strong> 2014, </strong>before reaching<strong> 4.7 million tonnes of CO2 </strong>in<strong> 2018.</strong></p>
