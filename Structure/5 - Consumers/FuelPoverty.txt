<p>In July 2019 the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2019/10/section/1/enacted">Fuel Poverty (Targets, Definition and Strategy) (Scotland)</a> Act received Royal Assent. This Act contains a new definition of <strong>fuel poverty</strong>: a household is in fuel poverty if, in order to maintain a satisfactory heating regime, total fuel costs necessary for the home are more than <strong>10%</strong> of the household&rsquo;s adjusted net <strong>income</strong> (after housing costs), and if after deducting fuel costs, benefits received for a care need or disability and childcare costs, the household&rsquo;s remaining adjusted net income is insufficient to maintain an acceptable standard of living. <strong>Extreme fuel poverty</strong> follows the same definition except that a household would have to spend more than 20% of its adjusted net income (after housing costs) on total fuel costs and maintain a satisfactory heating regime.</p>
<p>The Act sets <strong>targets</strong> to eradicate fuel poverty. The <strong>2040</strong> targets are that no more than <strong>5%</strong> of households in Scotland would be in <strong>fuel poverty</strong> and <strong>1%</strong> in <strong>extreme fuel poverty</strong>. There are interim targets that by no more than <strong>15%</strong> of households are in <strong>fuel poverty</strong> and no more than <strong>5%</strong> in <strong>extreme fuel poverty</strong> by <strong>2030</strong>. By <strong>2035</strong>, the targets are <strong>10%</strong> and <strong>3%</strong> respectively.</p>
<p>In <strong>2019</strong>, <strong>24.6%</strong> of households were estimated to be in fuel poverty, a similar level to <strong>2018</strong>. The 2019 fuel poverty rate is likely to reflect changes in fuel prices, income and energy efficiency. <strong>12.4%</strong>&nbsp;were living in&nbsp;<strong>extreme fuel poverty</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>. This is&nbsp;<strong>similar&nbsp;</strong>to 2018 but a&nbsp;<strong>decrease&nbsp;</strong>from the peak in 2013. Since 2015, the rate of extreme fuel poverty has remained stable at between 11% and 13%.</p>
<p>Levels of fuel poverty among households using&nbsp;<strong>electricity</strong>&nbsp;as their primary heating fuel have remained the highest, at&nbsp;<strong>43%,</strong>&nbsp;compared to households using gas (22%), oil (28%) and other fuel (31%) as their primary heating fuel.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency of homes is closely linked with fuel poverty; in <strong>2019</strong> just <strong>20% </strong>of households with an <strong>EPC band </strong>of <strong>B or C </strong>were fuel poor, compared to <strong>27%</strong> at <strong>band D</strong>, <strong>31%</strong> at <strong>band E </strong>and <strong>40% </strong>at <strong>bands F or G</strong>. The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficient-scotland-route-map/">Energy Efficient Scotland Routemap</a> sets the aim for all homes with households in fuel poverty to reach EPC C by 2030 and EPC B by 2040 (where technically feasible and cost effective). Over a third (<strong>39%</strong>) of <strong>fuel poor households</strong> currently have <strong>at least EPC band C</strong>.</p>
