<p>The way in which customers&nbsp;<strong>pay&nbsp;</strong>their energy bills may be able to tell us something about engagement and vulnerability of customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>majority&nbsp;</strong>of customers in Scotland pay by&nbsp;<strong>direct debit&nbsp;</strong>for electricity and gas, and this has gradually risen from&nbsp;<strong>44%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>September 2005&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;<strong>66%</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>December 2020</strong>&nbsp;for standard&nbsp;<strong>electricity</strong>, and from&nbsp;<strong>47%</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>68%</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>gas</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers paying by&nbsp;<strong>credit,&nbsp;</strong>that is paying on receipt of their bill,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>has declined in the same period, from <strong>36%</strong> to <strong>17%</strong> for <strong>electricity</strong> and <strong>44%</strong> to <strong>16%</strong> for <strong>gas</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prepayment&nbsp;</strong>requires the customer to make an advance payment before the fuel can be used.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepayment customers tend to be more likely to be in&nbsp;<strong>vulnerable&nbsp;</strong>circumstances than customers who pay for their energy through other means.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proportion of Scottish&nbsp;<strong>prepayment&nbsp;</strong>customers for electricity <strong>stabilised&nbsp;</strong>at approximately <strong>17%</strong>&nbsp;since 2005, suggesting that prepayment customers do not tend to move to other payment methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;<strong>gas&nbsp;</strong>it rose from&nbsp;<strong>9%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>September 2005&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;<strong>16%</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>December 2020</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall trend for gas indicates that credit customers have been&nbsp;moving to direct debit and prepayment.</p>
